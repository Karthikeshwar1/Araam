# :sparkles: Description

## What is it?

- A software which makes a game controller performs the actions of both a keyboard and a mouse
- The softwares operates in 2 modes:
  - Keyboard mode
  - Mouse mode
- A new way of [Human-Computer-Interaction (HCI)](https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/topics/human-computer-interaction)

<br>

## What is the use of it?

- Makes it easier to control the computer using just the game controller
- There might be a learning curve to get familiar with the software, but after that, it becomes more comfortable to use than a keyboard and a mouse
- This software can also be used as an accessibility feature, especially for people with difficulty in using the keyboard and the mouse

<br>

## Working methodology

The Dpad buttons and the left shoulder button are used as [modifier keys](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modifier_key).
The keyboard layout is divided into 7 sections, each of them comprising of 4 keys. The modifier keys lets the user focus on one of these sections, and then X, Y, B, A buttons can be used to select a character. In each of the sections, X, Y, B, A buttons are mapped to the keys in a clockwise manner. Even the modifier buttons used for focusing on the sections are mapped in a similar way. This makes it easier and intuitive to remember the key combinations.

## History

- [Douglas Engelbart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_Engelbart), the inventor of the computer mouse, invented the first [chorded keyboard](https://www.artofchording.com/layout/chorded-keyboard.html) in 1968 at what is often called [The Mother Of All Demos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mother_of_All_Demos).
- Today, there are many alternatives to using the conventional keyboard, like [keyer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keyer) and [stenotype](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stenotype).
  <br>
- Microsoft has designed and [patented](https://www.windowscentral.com/microsoft-has-patented-radial-keyboard-designed-xbox-joystick-typing) a radial keyboard for typing with the Xbox controller.

<br>

## :letter: Usage

- Press start and back simultaneously to switch between keyboard and mouse modes
- Hold down start and back buttons for a short period of time to exit the software
